    Howdy!
    <br />
    My site is offline at the moment, because I am implementing new categories.
    I am working really hard behind the scenes to create amazing content.
    Come back on 02/15/2020 and there will be a great new site!
    Even with the site offline, I am open for business. Want to get in contact?
    You can email me at mazonkeu@gmail.com
    All the best for now!
  </div>
);

export default Categories;
